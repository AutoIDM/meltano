## Visiting grant

Meltano is an all-remote company with team members all over the world. If you want to visit other team members to get to know them, Meltano will assist with travel expenses (e.g. flights, trains, parking, car rental, and ground transportation to/from airport) for a total of up to $150 for every team member that you visit. Please note lodging is excluded. To be clearer, if you meet 2 team members during your visit, the maximum limit of your visiting grant could be $300 ($150*2). You don't need to work on the same project or team. We'd like you to get to know each other and your roles at Meltano, so we encourage you to discuss work for at least part of the time you're meeting.

Please note: The visiting grant applies to transportation costs and not other expenses related to travel (e.g. lodging, food). It may be acceptable to cover a meal, however, if the meeting is pre-announced to other people in the region to encourage as many of them to attend as possible.

To claim the grant, include a line item on your expense report or invoice along with the receipt of your flights, trains, and/or transportation to/from the airport with a list of the team members you visited. The expense report may be submitted during the first month of travel or up to 3 months after your trip has concluded. That said, if it's more frugal to book and expense your travel further in advance, please do so.

The visiting grant is inspired by Douwe's trip around the world during his time at GitLab. Douwe met [49 colleagues in 20 cities, in 14 countries, on five continents, in 6 months](/blog/2017/01/31/around-the-world-in-6-releases/). 

### Significant life event grant

Recognizing that team members may wish to share significant events in each other's lives, such as weddings or civil partnerships, Meltano will assist with travel expenses to attend these events. This grant works the same way as the, except the reimbursement limit is $300 per team member you visit at an event.

## Family and Friends Day

Inspired by GitLab's Family and Friends Day, Meltano has made Family and Friends Day a regular part of the culture. On these days, we will close the doors to the Meltano virtual office, reschedule all meetings, and have a publicly visible shutdown.

Team members can share about their Family and Friends Day in the #family-and-friends-day Slack channel after the event, or publicly on social media such as Twitter, LinkedIn, or wherever they're most comfortable using the hashtag #FamilyFriends1st. Sharing is optional. Taking the day off is strongly encouraged if your role allows it.

### Upcoming Family and Friends Days

* 2021-08-20 - The first Meltano Family & Friends Day!
* 2021-09-17
* 2021-10-15
* 2021-11-24

These dates are tracked in the [Team Meetings Calendar](/handbook/#calendars). 
Meltano team members should mark these days off using [PTO by Roots](/handbook/tech-stack/#pto-by-roots).

In line with our Paid Time Off policy, we encourage Meltano team members to continue to take additional days off, as needed. 
Family and Friends Day is a reminder to do this.
