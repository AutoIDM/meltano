## Communication

We're an all-remote company that allows people to work from almost anywhere in the world, so it's important for us to practice clear communication in ways that help us stay connected and work more efficiently. We communicate respectfully and professionally at all times.

To accomplish this, we use asynchronous communication as a starting point and stay as open and transparent as we can by communicating through public issues, merge requests, and Slack channels. 

> Asynchronous communication is the practice of communicating and moving projects forward without requiring stakeholders to be available at the same time. 

Asynchronous communication demonstrates consideration for team members across time zones and enables us to travel outside of our usual time zone or structure our day around commitments at home or in our community. We practice asynchronous communication by recording meetings, using GitLab Issues and Merge Requests rather than texts, calls, or Slack messages, and being sensitive to local holidays and vacation statuses. We also place an emphasis on ensuring that conclusions of offline conversations are written down. All of these actions ensure that team members are not pressured to be online outside of their working hours. Embracing asynchronous communication and learning to use it effectively requires a mental shift. This can feel unusual or even uncomfortable for those who come from a colocated environment, where in-person meetings and communiques are the norm. 

### In practice
 
1. Aim to respond to mentions other than FYIs within 3 business days. If you are unable to fulfill a specific request during that time, respond to the mention and indicate when you'll have an answer.
1. If you're behind on responding to notifications and expect to miss a deadline for any new mentions (until you're caught up), please inform the team in the Kickoff, and ask that urgent requests be sent to you via Slack DM and include the issue/MR link.
1. Use direct language when communicating. If you want someone to take action, directly tell them what's required, and when you need an answer, and whether there is urgency. Also indicate whether something is a "must have" or "nice to have" when asking for collaboration. 
1. Overcommunication can be appropriate. You can mention someone in an issue, but we all know that sometimes we can miss something, so if a request has stagnated, you can send someone a direct message as a gentle reminder. If you need something urgently, you can also send a Slack message to request that something is prioritized. 

#### Slack guidelines

1. **Please avoid using @here or @channel unless something is urgent and important.** 
1. Use `FYI @username` when you want someone to be aware of what's being discussed, but they're not required to take action.
1. Use `@username` when you want someone to take a specific action, such as contributing to the discussion or answering a question.
1. If decisions are made on Slack, please either paste a screenshot of the conversation in the relevant issue/MR or provide a summary of what was discussed.

#### Issue and merge request guidelines

1. Use `FYI @username` when you want someone to be aware of what's being discussed, but they're not required to take action.
1. Use `@username` when you want someone to take a specific action, such as contributing to the discussion or answering a question.
1. Always remember that some people only work through GitLab TODOs, so if they're not directly mentioned, they will not receive a notification. 
1. Be mindful that issues and MRs are public by default, and our communication in them can be viewed by our community. Please always consider how we present ourselves to the public.

#### Email guidelines

1. Email should only be used when communicating with external vendors or when discussing sensitive, confidential matters (e.g. PeopleOps or financial situations).
1. Write `FYI` when you want someone to be aware of what's being discussed, but they're not required to take action.

### Best practices

1. **Kindness matters.** Always communicate with kindness and empahty. Everyone should be comfortable in their work environment.
1. **All written communication happens in English**, even when sent one on one, because sometimes you need to forward an email or chat.
1. **Own your actions**: If you say it or type it, own it. If it hurts the company or an individual, even unintentionally, we encourage you to look at things from other points of view and apologize easily.
1. **You're not expected to be available all the time**. There is no expectation to respond to messages outside of your planned working hours.
1. **Sometimes synchronous communication is the better option**, but do not default to it. For example, a video call can clear things up quickly when you are blocked. 
1. **It's okay to ask as many questions as you have**. Please ask them so that team members can provide and view answers. Use issues or public chat channels instead of direct messages or emails.
1. **Make merge requests to update the handbook with answers** to questions you've received.
1. **Include links when you mention something** (e.g. a merge request, issue, commit, webpage, comment).
1. **All company data should be shareable by default**. Don't use a local text file, but rather leave comments on an issue.
1. **Provide due dates or communicate your progress on tasks**. Answers like: "will do," 
OK," "it is on my todo list" are not helpful. If it's a small request, it's better to spend 2 minutes to do the task to unblock someone. If it's a large request that requires a time investment, then communicate that to the other person so that they can either solve it in another way if your timeframe exceeds their needs.
1. **Avoid creating private groups** for internal discussions, unless a topic is confidential. We aim to be transparent, and private discussions are not searchable and easily documented.
1. **Use [low-context communications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-context_and_low-context_cultures)** by being explicit in your communications. We are a remote-only company, located all over the world. Provide as much context as possible to avoid confusion. Relatedly, we use [ubiquitous language](#ubiquitous-language) for communication efficiency.
1. **Be careful not to lean too much into hypotheticals**. There is a tipping point in which it decreases value and no longer becomes constructive at helping everyone come into a unified decision.
1. **Focus on what we can directly influence.** There are many factors we can't directly influence and we should avoid spending time discussing those things. 
1. **Always adhere to our Anti-Harassment Policy and Code of Conduct.**
1. **Express your thoughts.** We live in different locations and often have very different perspectives. We want to know your thoughts, opinions, and feelings on things.
1. **Feedback is Essential.** It's difficult to know what is appropriate in every one of our team members' countries. We encourage team members to give feedback and receive feedback in a considerate way.

### Everyone is a Moderator

If you see something that concerns you in Slack, Issues, Merge Requests, Video, Emails or any other forum, we encourage you to respectfully say something directly to the individual in a 1:1 format. If you are not comfortable reaching out to the individual directly, please reach out to your direct manager or the Operations Analyst to discuss.

## Financial operations

Financial operations includes spending company money, guidelines, and the reimbursement policy. 

### Spending company money

We expect Meltano team members to take responsibility to determine what they need to purchase or expense in order to do their jobs effectively. We don't want you to have to wait with getting the items that you need to get your job done. You most likely know better than anyone else what the items are that you need to be successful in your job.

### Guidelines

1. Spend company money like it is your **own** money, but please make decisions with the company's best interest in mind.
1. You don't have to [ask permission](https://m.signalvnoise.com/if-you-ask-for-my-permission-you-wont-have-my-permission-9d8bb4f9c940) before making purchases **in the interest of the company**. When in doubt, do **inform** your manager prior to the purchase, or as soon as possible after the purchase.
1. It is generally easiest and fastest for you to make any purchases for office supplies yourself and expense them. If you are unable to pay for any supplies yourself, please reach out to your manager or the Operations Analyst to ask that they make the purchase on your behalf.
1. You may privately use Meltano property (e.g. MacBook), to check your private e-mails, or watch a movie as long as it does not violate the law, harm Meltano, or interfere with Intellectual Property. 
1. If you make a purchase that will cost Meltano $1000 USD per item (or over), this is classed as company property, you will be required to return the item(s) if you leave the company.
1. Any non-company expenses should not be paid with a company credit card.
1. If team members submit expenses for reimbursement for personal purchases that are not covered in the expense policy, this is a violation of our Code of Business Conduct & Ethics.

### Reimbursement policy

1. Purchases of at least $10 USD require a receipt.
1. Employees should file expense reports in the same month that the purchase was made. Contractors should include receipts with their invoices.
1. To be reimbursed for company expenses, please submit a report in [Expensify](/handbook/tech-stack/#expensify) (all team members). Non-US team members will also submit a report in Remote.

#### US team member reimbursement process

1. Upload receipts in Expensify and submit a report. Please use the appropriate tags/categories and include comments when appropriate. If a tag/category is missing, you may be asked to edit your report.
1. Team members in the US will be automatically reimbursed through Expensify after their report is "final approved." 

#### Non-US team member reimbursement process

Although non-US team members will not receive reimbursement through Expensify, the company needs to have a single source of truth for expenses. So, all team members will need to use Expensify. You'll then submit an additional report in Remote to receive reimbursement.

1. Upload receipts in Expensify and submit a report. Please use the appropriate tags/categories and include comments when appropriate. If a tag/category is missing, you may be asked to edit your report.
1. Create an invoice in [Remote](/handbook/tech-stack/#remote). 
1. The approved expense amount will be deposited in your account with your monthly salary.

### Office equipment and supplies

The company will reimburse for the following items if you **need it for work or use it mainly for business**, and local law allows us to pay for it without incurring payroll taxes. Please keep in mind that while the amounts below are guidelines and not strict limits, any purchase (other than a laptop) that will cost Meltano $1000 USD per item (or over) will require prior approval from your manager.

The below averages are what Meltano **usually** reimburses. If you prefer to spend more on a given item, that's okay considering the average price. You are also welcome to expense the `Meltano Average Price in USD` portion, and cover the rest with personal funds. For example, if you purchase a high-end Steelcase ergonomic chair, you are welcome to expense the average price per the table below and cover the rest with personal funds. We are encouraging our members to use their best judgment when spending the company's money.

When reimbursing through Expensify please select "reimbursable" for the portion which Meltano will be covering, and add a note explaining the receipt difference.

Team members should not use a Corporate Credit Card to purchase office equipment for their personal workspace.  All office equipment purchases for a team member's personal workspace should be made on a personal credit card and expensed.

#### Setting up a home office for the first time?

Meltano team members are encouraged to create a comfortable, ergonomic workspace. Please do research to find a chair, desk, and other equipment that facilitate good posture and healthy habits.

#### Software

1. We do not issue Microsoft Office 365 licenses, as Meltano uses [Google Workspace](/handbook/tech-stack/#google-workspace)
   (Docs, Slides, Sheets, etc.) instead.

##### Individual subscriptions

Meltano does not reimburse individual software subscriptions (e.g. Apple Music, Krisp, etc.).

###### Subscription exceptions

Certain types of individual subscriptions are reimbursable, such as VPN service. If you are uncertain whether a particular service is reimbursable, please contact the Operations Analyst.

#### Hardware

It is uncommon for you to need all of the items listed below. Please use your best judgement and buy them as you need them. If you wonder if something is common, feel free to ask your teammates.

If you wish to go over the recommended reimbursement, this is an exception and should first be raised with your manager and if supported, should be raised with the Operations Analyst who will review and respond to the request.

The technology price guidelines are based on acquiring products in the United States. Meltano understands prices may vary based on location. If the product cost is higher in your location, confirm that an equivalent product in the United States would be within the above price guidance.  

## Tools and technology

### Tech stack

View the [complete list](/handbook/tech-stack) of our tech stack. 

### Laptop configurations

Meltano approves the use of Apple and Linux operating systems, Windows is prohibited. The prohibition on Microsoft Windows is for the following reasons:

- While there has been security issues with all operating systems, due to the popularity of the Windows operating system it is the main platform targeted by attackers with spyware, viruses, and ransomware.
- macOS is pre-loaded onto Apple hardware.
    Linux is free.
    To take advantage of the features in Windows as a business, Meltano would have to purchase Windows Pro licensing as these business features are not available on Windows Home Edition.
    As many purchases of laptops have occurred with employees making the purchases and then being reimbursed by Meltano, a remote employee would typically be making a purchase of a laptop pre-loaded with Windows Home Edition.
- Windows Home Edition is notoriously [hard to secure](https://www.markloveless.net/blog/2019/1/15/dealing-with-windows-10).

Apple hardware is the common choice for most Meltano team members, but if you are comfortable using and self-supporting yourself with Linux (Ubuntu usually) you may also choose from the Dell builds below.

#### Apple Hardware

We recommend either:

1. (MacBook Pro) - [16”  / 512gig SSD / 32gig RAM / i9 or i7 CPU](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/16-inch-space-gray-2.6ghz-6-core-processor-512gb)

1. (MacBook Pro) - [13” / 512gig SSD / 16gigs RAM / i5 CPU](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/13-inch-space-gray-1.4ghz-quad-core-processor-with-turbo-boost-up-to-3.9ghz-256gb)

#### Linux hardware

Please only request a Linux laptop if you have experience with this operating system and its requirements, all others, select a MacBook.

We strongly encourage Macs, but we do allow Linux if you are capable of self-support and updates.

- For Engineers, Support Engineers, Data Analysts, Technical Marketing Managers, Product Designers, UX Managers, Product Managers, Technical Writers, Digital Production (Dell/Linux) - [16”  / 512gig SSD / 32gig RAM / i9 or i7 CPU ](https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-laptops-and-notebooks/precision-5540-mobile-workstation/spd/precision-15-5540-laptop/xctop554015us4?configurationid=01b3d81d-57ff-4f71-a79f-f6b81ab2a521)

- Everyone Else (Dell/Linux) - [13” / 256gig SSD / 16gigs RAM / Quad-Core i5 CPU](https://www.dell.com/ng/business/p/latitude-13-7300-laptop/pd)

\*\*NOTE: Max price: **the price of the equivalent [16” MacBook pro laptop](#apple-hardware)**. Please make sure you order this model minimum 14 days, based on your locality, prior to your desired date to receive.

For Linux laptops, our **standard laptop provider is Dell** which generally comes pre-loaded with Ubuntu Linux,(to save money by not purchasing a Windows license). Dell in Australia and New Zealand are unable to currrently pre load with Ubuntu Linux, so staff will need to install Linux onto the devices once they've been received.

The reasons for using Dell for a Linux laptop are as follows:

- There are several manufacturers of laptop systems that offer Linux, but Dell is the only major manufacturer that has done so for years, and it has already worked out shipping issues for all of the countries where Meltano employees live.

- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS is the preferred platform due to both stability and an extremely fast patch cycle - important for security patches.

- There are opportunities for corporate discounts in the future if we can concentrate purchases from a single vendor.

- Dell is a [certified Ubuntu vendor](https://certification.ubuntu.com/desktop/models?query=&category=Desktop&category=Laptop&level=&release=18.04+LTS&vendors=Dell) with plenty of laptop choices available. They even have their own Ubuntu OEM release of Ubuntu they maintain, and as a result of their effort, the standard Ubuntu 18.04 LTS image natively supports Dell hardware and even firmware updates.

- To date, all of Dell's security issues have involved their use of Windows, not their hardware.

### Paid time off

Meltano has an unlimited time off policy, and we encourage team members to take the time they need to rest and recharge. 

We recommend every team member takes a minimum 30 days off a year, and we have recommended minimums for various life events, including:

* Minimum 15 days for compassionate leave 
* Minimum 15 days for victims of domestic violence
* Minimum 15 days for burnout

To log time off, team members should use PTO by Roots in Slack.

#### PTO by Roots

[PTO by Roots](https://treehoppr.com/pto-ninja) allows employees and managers to coordinate time off seamlessly with intuitive Slack commands. PTO by Roots also reminds employees of their upcoming time off and helps them assign roles and tasks for co-workers, giving all parties involved greater alignment and peace of mind.

[PTO by Roots Training Video](https://vimeo.com/469045356)

Please be aware that new team members' PTO by Roots accounts are activated and synced automatically once a day, so if you try to access PTO by Roots on your first day and receive an error message, please attempt to access PTO by Roots on Day 2. If you still receive an error message, let your assigned People Ops Specialist know in your onboarding issue.

##### Slack Commands
* `/pto-roots ooo` Create an OOO event.
* `/pto-roots whosout` See upcoming OOO for everyone in the channel where this command is used.
* `/pto-roots @username`  Check if a particular person is OOO and if they are, see which of your co-workers are covering for them.
* `/pto-roots @usergroup See upcomming OOO for everyone on the particualr user group.
* `/pto-roots feedback` This is your direct line to support. At any time, use this command to report bugs or share your thoughts on how the product can be improved or what’s working well.
* `/pto-roots help` A top-level look at PTO by Roots items that you may need help with, and how to receive help.

##### Home Tab

You can find the Home Tab by visiting `Apps` in the menu bar within Slack, and search for or select PTO by Roots.  From the Home Tab you  can do the follwoing.

* View your OOO dashboard to edit, add or remove OOO events. 
* Modify your profile and calendar settings. 
* Opt-in and out-put for reminders, including monthly messages prompting you to consider what PTO you may take this month.

##### Additional Features

###### Google Calendar Sync

PTO by Roots allows you to sync time off requests with your Google Calendar.

###### Automatic Status + Do Not Disturb Updates

PTO by Roots can automatically set your OOO status in Slack and apply “Do Not Disturb” settings while you’re away. You must add these permissions individually.

###### Roles and task handoffs

PTO by Roots provides an experience that allows you to set roles and tasks for co-workers while
you’re away. Accepted roles then become a part of a Slack away message that appears as
co-workers try to tag you in discussions while you’re OOO.

Before assigning a `#channel` to a role, please ask for permission to do so in that channel.
Especially in large channels and during popular vacation times, PTO's role reminders could create a lot of noise, so some teams may recommend against them until there is an option to allow turning off the PTO notifications.

###### Bulk add holidays

You can bulk add holidays based on your region and then modify them manually if needed. Any Public Holidays added to PTO by Roots in your dashboard will not auto-set an OOO event for you, you will still need to create an OOO event if observing that holiday. To add a Public Holiday, follow the below instructions.

* Visit `Apps` in the menu bar within Slack, and search for or select PTO by Roots
* Choose `Holidays` from the dropdown menu
* Choose the desired year
* Click on `Bulk Add By Region`

###### Monthly reminder to consider taking PTO

We get it — life gets busy. So busy, in fact, that you may need a little nudge to consider taking time off to recharge. PTO by Roots allows you to subscribe (and unsubscribe) to a monthly prompt, sent on the first *working* day of each month, reminding you to pause and think about time away from work and prioritizing mental health.

To subscribe or unsubscribe, follow the below instructions:

* Visit `Apps` in the menu bar within Slack, and search for or select PTO by Roots
* Select `Profile` from the dropdown
* Beneath your name and profile, you'll see a line that says "Send me a monthly reminder about taking time off." Click the **Subscribe** button to trigger the notification, which will begin on the first *working* day (e.g. not a weekend or a public holiday) in the month following your subscription.
* To unsubscribe, revisit PTO by Roots within Slack Apps and click the button that says **Unsubscribe**.

###### Checking "Who's Out?"

In order to see who is out of your team, follow the steps below:

* Go to the PTO by Roots application in Slack
* In the `Home` section, select `Who's Out?` from the dropdown list
* Click `new search` to view who is out by `#channel`, `@usergroup`, or `@username`

### Visiting grant

**Note**: To keep team members and our communities safe, we've temporarily suspended the visiting grant until travel is less of a risk around the world. We'll provide updates to team members and will regularly review this policy over the course of the pandemic.

Meltano is an all-remote company with team members all over the world. If you want to visit other team members to get to know them, Meltano will assist with travel expenses (e.g. flights, trains, parking, car rental, and ground transportation to/from airport) for a total of up to $150 for every team member that you visit. Please note lodging is excluded. To be clearer, if you meet 2 team members during your visit, the maximum limit of your visiting grant could be $300 ($150*2). You don't need to work on the same project or team. We'd like you to get to know each other and your roles at Meltano, so we encourage you to discuss work for at least part of the time you're meeting.

Please note: The visiting grant applies to transportation costs and not other expenses related to travel (e.g. lodging, food). It may be acceptable to cover a meal, however, if the meeting is pre-announced to other people in the region to encourage as many of them to attend as possible.

To claim the grant, include a line item on your expense report or invoice along with the receipt of your flights, trains, and/or transportation to/from the airport with a list of the team members you visited. The expense report may be submitted during the first month of travel or up to 3 months after your trip has concluded. That said, if it's more frugal to book and expense your travel further in advance, please do so.

The visiting grant is inspired by Douwe's trip around the world during his time at GitLab. Douwe met [49 colleagues in 20 cities, in 14 countries, on five continents, in 6 months](/blog/2017/01/31/around-the-world-in-6-releases/). 

#### Significant life event grant

Recognizing that team members may wish to share significant events in each other's lives, such as weddings or civil partnerships, Meltano will assist with travel expenses to attend these events. This grant works the same way as the, except the reimbursement limit is $300 per team member you visit at an event.

### Family and Friends Day

Inspired by GitLab's Family and Friends Day, Meltano has made Family and Friends Day a regular part of the culture. On these days, we will close the doors to the Meltano virtual office, reschedule all meetings, and have a publicly visible shutdown. Taking the day off is strongly encouraged if your role allows it. If you are on call or need to work during the scheduled Friends and Family Day, please select another day that works best for your schedule.

#### Upcoming Family and Friends Days

* 2021-10-15
* 2021-11-24

These dates are tracked in the Team Meetings Calendar. 
Meltano team members should mark these days off using PTO by Roots.

In line with our Paid Time Off policy, we encourage Meltano team members to continue to take additional days off, as needed. 
Family and Friends Day is a reminder to do this.

## Business operations

### Calendar quarters

Use calendar quarters (e.g. 2021-Q4) rather than fiscal quarters (e.g. FY22-Q4) when discussing time.
